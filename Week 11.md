* Working on the Report 

In the eleventh week, I dedicated time to continue working on the project report. This involved documenting the research, development, and testing phases of the project in detail.

As the lab was shifted. I have to calibrate the camera again.



I tried to take the pictures of the symmetric dots pattern but it was not detecting it.

I tried to change the position of the camera and also used external lighting for proper recognition. Still I was not getting the pattern detected.

Then I decided to change the dot pattern. I kept a new symmetric grid of 11x7 grid pattern. 


I placed the camera in a position that the pattern is clearly visible. I adjusted the height, zoom lens and focus.

I clicked several pictures from the camera and then again tried to detect the pattern.


The pattern was detected properly.
