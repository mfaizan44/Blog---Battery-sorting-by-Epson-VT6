## Blog 

## Welcome Everyone. Welcome to my Blog.

I want to do a project for my Masters Final year Robotics.
After several consideration I decided to work on sorting of Batteries using epson VT6 Robot.

I am using three types of batteries - 9v, D and AA
I am using Epson VT 6 Robot/
This robot is a 6 axis robot and is controlled by Epson RC + 7.0 Software.

I was studying and working simultaneously so I decided to invest 2 days a week on my project as my regular Course Classes.

## Setup
