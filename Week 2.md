##  Week 2

# 25th June 2024
In the second week, I meticulously selected the hardware and components needed for the battery sorting system. 
## Hardware Selection:
Finalized the hardware components:
* EPSON VT6 Robot
* Electronic gripper (requires 5V power supply)
* Three battery types: AA, D, 9V
* Camera for real-time monitoring
* Sorting boxes
This selection process included not only the main robot and camera but also additional peripherals like electromagnet gripper.

* Dataset Collection:  
Captured images for the dataset, using three batteries of each type in a single frame, totaling 9 batteries.

I also began preparing the dataset that would be used for training the model to recognize different battery types. This involved collecting images of various batteries, ensuring that the dataset was comprehensive enough to cover all the variations the system might encounter during operation.
