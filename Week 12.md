### Teaching the points and calibrating with the camera

I manually jog the robot from the software and started to teach the robots all the four corner points.

After reaching each corner position I noted down the  cordinates of the corners.

As the height is same - Z remains the same.

### Teaching the points and Calibrating with the camera
The calibration process was revisited to ensure that the system was functioning optimally. This involved making minor adjustments to improve the precision of the robot's movements and the accuracy of the camera's detections. The focus was on achieving a seamless integration between the hardware and software components of the system.

After uploading the corner coordinates NPZ files for corner points was saved successfully.

Repeating the same procedure and teaching all the three drop points. Noting down the coordinates.

After uploading the dop points NPZ files for drop points was saved successfully.
