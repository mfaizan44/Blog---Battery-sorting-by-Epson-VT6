 As now the coordinates are correct. The camera is sending proper commands to the robot.
Now I wanted the electromagnet to work properly.
I connected that to an external 12v DC power supply

I started to test the accuracy. i wanted to know how accurately the battery positions are working.

According to battery type i have to adjust the height of the pick up positon. For eg: If the battery is D type the elctromagnet should be at a good height.

For D type - 32.5mm

For AA type - 16.7mm

For 9v Type - 13.7mm

I tested the accuracy of each time several times.

I wanted to try that if i place a battery outside the grid will it give correct coordinates.

It was not accurate but since the end of arm of the robot is magnet it wont have problem. In the above video the electromagnet was OFF as I was just checking.
