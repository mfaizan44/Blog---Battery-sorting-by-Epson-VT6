# Week 7
## 30th July and  31st July : Exploration of Current Solutions for Battery Sorting
Continuing from the previous week, I explored current solutions for battery sorting in greater detail. This involved a close examination of technologies like optical and magnetic sorting, as well as advanced methods such as X-ray sorting. I analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each approach to understand their applicability to my project.

Case Study: LINEV Systems EU

A prime example of cutting-edge battery sorting technology is offered by LINEV Systems EU, a company that specializes in X-ray imaging solutions. Their battery sorting systems leverage advanced X-ray technology to provide highly accurate sorting capabilities, capable of distinguishing between different battery chemistries and types with remarkable precision. The system can even detect damaged or partially discharged batteries, ensuring that they are handled appropriately to prevent any risk of environmental contamination or safety hazards.

LINEV Systems' X-ray sorting technology is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing recycling processes, providing a high-throughput solution that can handle large volumes of batteries with minimal manual intervention. The system's ability to operate continuously with low maintenance requirements makes it an ideal choice for large-scale recycling facilities looking to enhance their sorting efficiency and accuracy.
