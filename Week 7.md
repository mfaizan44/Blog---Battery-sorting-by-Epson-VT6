The Principles Behind Battery Sorting
Identification Precision
The battery sorting system typically operates by employing various sensors and sorting mechanisms to identify and separate different types of batteries based on unique and distinctive features, such as shape, chemistry, label, and internal structure.


Technologies in Action
The system may utilize sensors, such as optical scanners or magnetic sensors, to identify the type of battery. It must gather information about the chemical composition of the battery currently in view based on recognized characteristics.

Several technologies are available that can achieve a high percentage of accuracy in determining the composition of a battery.

Systems based on machine vision rely on a single parameter—the resulting image from the camera. Recognition is limited to the shape and the presence of distinctive features on the label design.

One drawback of this approach is its complete dependence on the external state of the label. Any contamination or damage to the outer layer of the battery can result in significant errors in determination.

With identifying counterfeit types of batteries, erroneous identification may occur, as this method cannot discern the actual internal structure.

Another type of system is based on magnetic resonance. In this system, two parameters are utilised: measuring battery weight and measuring magnetic properties.

This approach necessitates the preliminary sorting of batteries by size, which complicates the design and introduces additional operational challenges.

Furthermore, this system encounters difficulties in accurately identifying various types of lithium batteries with complex chemical compositions.

A system based on X-ray radiation can boast the highest levels of accuracy and capability in identifying almost all types of batteries.

Acquiring an X-ray image of the battery being identified enables the extraction of comprehensive information about the internal chemical composition, structure, and shape.

The amalgamation of all this data enables the achievement of nearly 100% sorting accuracy, eliminating the shortcomings of previous methods.

These systems incorporate complete radiation protection and do not require special operational conditions.

Let AI Take the Lead: Navigating Battery Types
Database Decision-Making
After receiving a set of data, the next step involves determining the battery type. This is achieved through the use of a large database containing pre-defined reference models.

The algorithm compares the received data with these known models to produce the final result. The accuracy and speed of this process depend directly on the training and configuration of the artificial intelligence.

The learning process is always unique and time-consuming, given the vast number of batteries worldwide with diverse chemical compositions and design features. This step significantly influences sorting accuracy and should be approached with particular care.

Mechanical Mastery: Tailored Sorting Devices
Precision Sorting Devices
Sorting devices come into operation. Once identified, the system employs mechanical arms or conveyor belts equipped with distribution devices to place batteries into individual compartments based on their chemistry.

Numerous hardware devices can perform this task, with one example being the pneumatic system. A robust airflow through a series of nozzles redirects the batteries to the required basket. The system does not require regular maintenance but necessitates a constant supply of high-pressure air to ensure continuous operation.

Electromechanical rotators with blades are also used, capable of propelling the battery off the conveyor at the right moment. However, the use of such mechanisms limits the overall system performance because of the low response speed.

Sometimes, a robotic arm is employed, capable of snatching a designated battery from a common pile moving along a conveyor belt. This solution is quite expensive and is only used in low-performance sorters where the need is to select not only individual batteries but also assemblies, electronic devices with batteries, and vehicle batteries.

Guardians of Quality in Sorting Systems
Quality Control Measures
Some sorting systems also incorporate quality control measures to ensure that the percentage of recognised batteries does not exceed the specified limit. To achieve this, maintenance regulations are implemented to monitor the installation’s condition, addressing critical contamination and component breakdowns.

Statistical algorithms in the software record logs and analyse the current operating parameters of the installation. Additional sensors are installed to control the sorting process, preventing unexpected blockages in the movement of batteries through the system. Components requiring periodic adjustment are also monitored.

Telemetry Services for Proactive Support
The use of telemetry services allows the manufacturer to continuously monitor the system’s lifespan and provide prompt, proactive recommendations to clients, offering user support globally at any time.

By combining these elements, the battery sorting system efficiently organizes batteries for either recycling or appropriate disposal, contributing to environmental sustainability and safety.

FROM INNOVATION
TO IMPLEMENTATION:
A CASE STUDY ON BATTERY
X-RAY SORTING

## INTRODUCTION
### BACKGROUND
Advancing Battery Sorting through 
X-ray Technology 
For over 30 years, LINEV Systems has been a leading 
player in the X-ray equipment market, with business 
partners in 85 countries. Among our longstanding 
partners is Seval Srl, an Italian company specializing in 
the recycling and sorting electronic waste, batteries, 
and metals. To enhance their battery sorting 
capabilities, Seval Srl adopted the BSS160X X-ray 
sorting installation, developed by LINEV Systems, 
enabling them to sort between 350kg and 500 kg of 
unsorted batteries per hour.

Empowering Eco-friendly Solutions in 
Waste Management
 In addition to their expertise in the high-voltage power 
lines sector, Seval Srl diversified into the Ecologia 
division in 1999, focusing on the emerging market of 
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). 
Today, they lead the WEEE market with 8 facilities, 
handling over 130,000 tons of waste annually. Seval 
collaborates directly with major global electronics 
manufacturers, recovering materials like metals, 
plastics and precious materials through authorized and 
monitored processes.

### BACKGROUND
Pioneering a Breakthrough in Battery 
Sorting 
Several years ago, a battery collection company 
approached LINEV Systems with the goal of increasing 
their revenue through battery sorting and obtaining a 
purer fraction during the recycling process. A team of 
innovative specialists at LINEV Systems embarked on 
the development of a battery sorting system utilizing 
X-ray technology. The process involved several years of 
work to create the system and develop algorithms for 
the automatic identification of battery types based on 
X-ray images. The result was the Batteray BSS160X 
solution, which has since become an unparalleled tool 
for addressing the challenges faced by LINEV Systems' 
customers worldwide.

## Challenges
Overcoming Limitations with Smart X-ray 
Solutions 
In an effort to automate the power element sorting line 
and increase processing capacities, Seval Srl tested various 
sorting technologies like ultrasound and optical ones. As 
these systems failed to meet the company's requirements, 
Seval and other partners started to develop a X-ray sorting 
system. It was at a conference dedicated to battery 
recycling technologies that Seval representatives 
discovered the potential of Linev X-ray technology for 
sorting power elements and battery recycling. After Revolutionizing Battery Sorting with 
Unmatched Efficiency 
The BSS160X system became a key component in the 
sorting line, successfully sorting power elements into the 
following groups: Li-Ion, Li-Primary, NiMH, NiCd, Alkaline, 
and ZnC. With the ability to simultaneously sort approxi
mately 1 ton of batteries per hour, the system achieved 
maximum productivity. The constant presence of operators 
is not required, allowing for optimal resource planning and 
load management of the sorting line.
studying the technical features of the BSS160X X-ray 
sorting system and exploring the equipment's capabilities, 
Seval decided to quit its project and procure the system.

Unraveling Counterfeits and Enabling 
Cleaner Recycling
 Additionally, the X-ray system BSS160X proved effective in 
detecting counterfeit batteries (fake labelling), which are 
impossible to identify by other means due to their striking 
similarity in markings and mass with genuine NiMH 
batteries or other chemistries. Our system not only 
enables battery sorting but also provides a purer fraction 
for recycling (alkaline and ZnC batteries that are the most 
relevant fraction can reach 99.95% purity). Obtaining a 
clean fraction, free from contamination by other types of 
power elements, is crucial during the recycling process of 
specific battery types, as primary materials, black mass, 
may become contaminated, resulting in increased costs for 
purification

Expanding Possibilities and Collaborative 
Innovations
 After gaining substantial knowledge and experience with 
the BSS160X system, Seval approached us with an 
initiative to sort Li-Primary batteries into distinct groups, 
namely Li-MnO2
 (Lithium Manganese Dioxide), Li-SOCl2 
(Lithium Thionyl Chloride), and Li-FeS2
 (Lithium Iron 
Disulfide). 
We enthusiastically supported this initiative and collabora
tively embarked on implementing the project to introduce 
new battery sorting types. During the process, Seval 
provided samples of these battery groups, and we 
developed algorithms for their identification and sorting 
using the BSS160X battery sorting installation. This project 
will significantly accelerate the lithium battery (Li-Primary) 
sorting process compared to manual methods currently 
employed by all companies in the market.

 Driving Innovation through Customer 
Collaboration
 Our collaboration with customers allows us to continually 
discover new applications for the BSS160X system. We are 
also open to developing new types of installations and 
tackling our customers' more complex challenges. We are 
eager to explore innovative ways to utilize sorting systems 
on recycling and sorting lines for batteries, opening up new 
possibilities for their application.

CONCLUSION
 LINEV Systems and Seval Srl's partnership showcases how 
X-ray technology has revolutionized battery sorting, 
enabling eco-friendly waste management solutions, 
uncovering counterfeits, and reducing costs for recycling 
processes. The collaboration continues to drive innovation 
and expand possibilities for future applications.
