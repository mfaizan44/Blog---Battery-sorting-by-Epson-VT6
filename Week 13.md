I started testing whether the camera is giving the proper coordinates or not.

## The coordinates from camera point of view and robot view are different.

After taking several battery positions in both view coordinates. I came up with two formulas. So i took one equation out of each of the two formulas.
Then I implemented that in the python code.

My python script was not working with the USB Serial connector.

I thought to connect with a local router with a local IP address but then I directly connected the robot with the ethernet cable.
