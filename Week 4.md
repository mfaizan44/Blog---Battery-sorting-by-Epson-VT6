# Week 4

# 9th July 2024
Labelling the Dataset
I Labelled more than 1500 images of the dataset


# 10th July 2024
I plan to have following features in my project
1. Real time camera
2. Create a frame to derive the distance from the camera and the robot hand
3. magnetic gripper should be able to cordinate with the robot hand distance so that it turns ON
4. a screen should pop up showing us the footage of the camera with labels of correct batteries
